# Basketball Analytics | A complete to the Basics of Basketball Sports Science

## How Business analytics in sports helps teams make proper decisions for their player development, winning strategies and eventual success

## Background

The Analytics of basketball comprises of basketball stats — from the basics _(Points(PTS), Rebounds(REBs(oREBS,dREBS)), Assists(ASTs), Steals(STLs), Turnovers(TOVs or TOs), Personal fouls(PFs))_ to the more detailed and advanced statistics like (player efficiency, assist-to-turnover ratio).

As the game of basketball has unfolded over the years and continued to evolve in various ways, be it the new rules, new playing styles, game tempo, dress code, or new equipment, one of the biggest developments that has influenced the game is the rise of data analytics which has ushered in an era of Basketball Analytics, as cog in the sports science space.

> _Sports analytics encompasses a set of data management technologies and computational techniques for gathering and interpreting observable statistical data about athletes and game play. Team executives use statistical analysis to evaluate players for drafting, trades, and contract negotiations. Coaches use analytics to understand competitors’ tendencies, to develop in-game strategies, and to identify areas for player improvement._ — [BY ERIC S. HINTZ, Sports Analytics Before Moneyball(AUGUST 1, 2022)](https://invention.si.edu/sports-analytics-moneyball)

The game of basketball is now taught, understood and played in ways that have never existed in the history of the sport with the power of basketball analytics, at the hands of franchise owners, basketball executives, agents, analysts, coaches, and even players.

## Introduction to basketball and it's history

[Basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball) is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.

The [game of Basketball](https://www.britannica.com/sports/basketball/Play-of-the-game) was invented by a Canadian-American physical education Professor namely, [Dr.James Naismith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith) around December 1, 1891, at the [International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education. Basketball is arguably the only major sport strictly of U.S. origin even though Naismith was born in Canada.

In early December 1891, Canadian-American physical education professor and instructor, [Dr. James Naismith](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Naismith), while at the [International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield_College), invented the [game of Basketball](https://www.britannica.com/sports/basketball/Play-of-the-game) in an attempt to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.

Dr. Naismith was looking for a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied, at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters, passing over several other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, eventually writing the basic rules of the game as well as nailing a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track.

Unlike, modern [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball) nets, in Dr. Naismith's original concept of basketball, the peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; which proved inefficient, eventually leading to the bottom of the basket being removed, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.

The  was also originally played with a soccer ball with the first balls made specifically for basketball being brown. It was only in the late 1950s that [Tony Hinkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hinkle), searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. Dribbling only became a major part of the game around the 1950s, as manufacturing improved the ball shape.

The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point and whichever team got the most points won the game.

The backboard was introduced to prevent shot interference during games since the baskets originally being nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court proved impractical when spectators on the balcony began to interfere with shots. the backboard also had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.

Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called "Duck on a Rock", as many had failed before it. Naismith called the new game "Basket Ball". 

The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York on January 20, 1892 with nine players. The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

## A brief History of Basketball Analytics

Professional basketball over the past ten years or so (_around 2013, when proper basketball analytics begun_), has looked very different thanks to the use of Data Analytics. According to the National Association of Basketball Coaches, [Howard Hobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hobson) – who had led Oregon to the first NCAA championship in 1939 – became one of the first coaches to analyze the game statistically.

[Howard Andrew "Hobby" Hobson (July 4, 1903 – June 9, 1991)](https://goducks.com/honors/hall-of-fame/howard-hobson/112) was an American basketball player and coach of football, basketball, and baseball.

He even published a book on shooting percentages and other phases of the game called [‘Scientific Basketball’](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36774116-scientific-basketball) in 1949,and even though his revolutionary ideas didn't catch on immediately at the time, [Howard Hobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hobson)’s research helped lead to the eventual widening of the free-throw lane and the implementation of the shot clock and 3-point line.

Many sports fans first became aware of sports analytics from [Michael Lewis’s bestselling book Moneyball (2003)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=RhlGNJBEKs&rank=1), and the [Moneyball(2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/)  film adaptation starring [Brad Pitt](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/?ref_=tt_ov_st) as [Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane). The book and film describe how [Beane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Beane) deployed [moneyball](https://rpubs.com/michaelmccrory/moneybag#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Moneyball%20Theory%E2%80%9D%20as%20it,therefore%2C%20translates%20to%20more%20wins.), an unorthodox mathematical techniques to find high-performing but undervalued baseball players, which helped his low-payroll baseball team compete successfully against wealthier clubs.

Basketball statistics are used in different ways by different people with different objectives. For example, Players, team executives, reporters, parents, coaches, analysts, researcher and fans will often refer to the box score after a game to assess how well (or how badly) a game was played or how individual players performed.

* Players can check Stats to identify their individual strengths and weaknesses, those of opponents or teams generally.
* Coaches often use statistics to decide which player to put in the game for certain scenarios or matchups and rotations to utilize for particular games among other coaching decisions.
* Scouts use statistics to rank and rate players in order to figure out which players to recruit to their teams.
Sports analysts use statistics as a way to spark a debates, conversations by building narratives like _Who’s the GOAT?_, _Which player has impacted the game most_, _Players suited to be in the MVP conversation in a season_ among other topics.
* Executives like Owners, Head of operations, General managers, and other front office personnel can use statistics to determine the salary of a player, player to trade or trade for among other management decisions.

In the mid-50s, Air Force head coach [Bob Spear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Spear_(basketball)) and assistant [Dean Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Smith), who would later become a Hall of Famer following an illustrious 36-year stint at North Carolina, created a possession evaluation system that assessed a team’s performance both offensively and defensively. Smith believed box score numbers and total points scored and allowed didn’t tell the whole story of a game partly because it failed to take into account the pace or total number of possessions.

This goes to show how important basketball analytics is in the game of basketball today as well as other sports like football, rugby, etc.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, the sports analytics community began to flourish among hobbyists and bloggers on the World Wide Web in it's early stages. [Lawrence Dean Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Oliver_(statistician)), an engineering student and varsity basketball player at Caltech, was among the first statisticians to transition from traditional books and subscription newsletters to personal web pages and user groups as a cheaper and more accessible publishing platform. In 1990-1991, Oliver began posting his basketball analyses on a personal website he called the [Journal of Basketball Studies](https://www.rawbw.com/~deano/about/welcome.html). He's also the Author of, [Basketball on Paper](http://www.basketballonpaper.com/index.html)-The basic handbook for doing basketball analysis worldwide, Endorsed by [Dean Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Smith) and [Bill James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_James).

Teams today are using basic and advanced analytics to designing winning strategies, predicting and avoiding player injury, player training programs, scouting, determine player value during trades and even make boardroom business decisions that generate revenue as well as strategic partnerships.

## Basketball Analytics

Every team now has at least one data analyst or statistician and every move is calculated with the aim of optimizing for winning strategies. In a game where DATA is now a business priority among other aspects, questions like, _how is data analytics being used in the context of the game, the players and the sports business aspect?_ are asked frequently in sports circles to try and understand if Basketball Analytics is really creating value or instead turned the game of basketball from fun and eventful to predictable and boring?

One of the areas where Sports Science' basketball analytics has impacted the game is in player development. Playing style patterns, player tendencies, and Weaknesses, Strengths and Efficiencies that were once difficult to evaluate by the human eye(_Eye Test_) are now more easily documented and quantifiable through rising technologies such as body sensors, wearables and on-court cameras. Collected data can now enable athletes become more efficient by studying their **SWOTs;-**

* Strengths(_Thing a player does well on and off the court and how to improve on them._)
* weaknesses (_Areas where a player struggles to assess what opportunities to utilize for improvement and growth._)
* Opportunities( _like;- tools and avenues to facilitate improvement, trade value, better pay days, and growth_)
* Threat(_The impediments to their growth or opportunities on and off the court._)

more conveniently and also informs coaches and trainers how they can help their players improve. In fact Basketball analytics is now an essential part of scouting, as executives and coaches rely on predictive analytics to make draft selections among other decisions.

A key consideration, should be for teams, executives, coaches, technical staff, analysts, and even fans to use basketball analytics sparingly until data models are perfect and should consider other factors when making decisions especially those that involve human psychology, gut feeling/instincts from experience, the "eye test" and most especially knowing when to make judgement calls or listen to data models to preserve the “fun” and “unpredictable” aspects of this beautiful sport of basketball.

This is because some basketball analytics data models do not holistically assess the players’ performance and often miss key aspects like a player's psychology, state of mind, and relation with other teammates or against particular teams, player-matchups or even venue/court.

For example, it's not yet very easy to predict whether a player can be a good team player considering Basketball is predominantly based on team chemistry thus a player could be a star player but may not necessarily excel, be a good locker room presence when put in the wrong team or paired with certain players or even coached by a particular coach.

Therefore while tracking these various statistics, its important to note that although statistics are important, there are some qualities that are just as important but don’t show up in a box score. Leadership, good teammate(good locker-room presence/team player), making adjustments on the fly, following instructions, watching film ahead of match-ups, for being coachable, or sportsmanship. You will often hear the team, "passing the eye test" thrown around in basketball or sports circles, and these out-side basketball statistics qualities are exactly what it means.

These and a few other interests are the aspects understanding basketball analytics tries to navigate. Basketball Analytics can be used effectively while preserving the fun aspects of the game if properly understood.

* Point Center is a player at the **Center** position with the ability to point the ball.
* Guards comprise of the back court while the Forwards & Center comprise of the front court on every 5 man team.

### The Four Factors OF Basketball Success

How do basketball teams win games? While searching for an answer to that question, Dean Oliver identified what he called the "Four Factors of Basketball Success":

1. Shooting (40%)
2. Turnovers (25%)
3. Rebounding (20%)
4. Free Throws (15%)

The number in parentheses is the approximate weight Mr. Oliver assigned each factor. Shooting is the most important factor, followed by turnovers, rebounding, and free throws. These factors can be applied to both a team's offense and defense, which in a sense gives us eight factors. Let's take a closer look at how these factors are measured, using the 2004-05 Phoenix Suns as an example.

Four Factors are the box score derived metrics that correlate most closely with winning basketball games. These factors also identify a team’s strategic strengths and weaknesses. Four factors can be applied to both a team’s offense and defense, hence it gives us eight factors.

1) Team’s Own Effective Field Goal Percentage
2) Team’s Own Turnover Percentage
3) Team’s Own Offensive Rebound Percentage
4) Team’s Own Free Throw Rate
5) Opponent’s Effective Field Goal Percentage
6) Opponent’s Turnover Percentage
7) Team’s Own Defensive Rebound Percentage (defensive rebound can be found by subtracting offensive rebounds from total rebounds)
8) Opponent’s Free Throw Rate

1. Shooting
The shooting factor is measured using Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%). The formula for both offense and defense is ``(FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA``.
``Effective Field Goal Percentage=(Field Goals Made) + 0.5*3P Field Goals Made))/(Field Goal Attempts)``

2. Turnovers
The turnover factor is measured using Turnover Percentage (TOV%). The formula for both offense and defense is
``TOV / (FGA + 0.44 * FTA + TOV)``.
``Turnover Rate = Turnovers/(Field Goal Attempts + 0.44*Free Throw Attempts + Turnovers)``

3. Rebounding
The rebounding factor is measured using Offensive and Defensive Rebound Percentage (ORB% and DRB%, respectively). The formula for offense is ``ORB / (ORB + Opp DRB)``, while the formula for defense is ``DRB / (Opp ORB + DRB)``.
``Offensive Rebounding Percentage = (Offensive Rebounds)/[(Offensive Rebounds)+(Opponent’s Defensive Rebounds)]``

4. Free Throws
The free throw factor is a measure of both how often a team gets to the line and how often they make them. The formula for both offense and defense is ``FT / FGA``.
``Free Throw Rate=(Free Throws Made)/(Field Goals Attempted) or Free Throws Attempted/Field Goals Attempted``

### Common Basketball Statistics Abbreviations

The NBA season is split over two calendar years, with the year given as the last year for that season, e.g. the year for the 2023-24 season would be 2024. in Uganda an entire FUBA Season happens within One year thus 2024 and not 2023-24 like the NBA.
* Opp - Opponent.
* W - Wins: The most important goal in sports unless your team is not tanking.
* Win Probability - The estimated probability that Team A will defeat Team B in a given matchup.

* SOS - Strength of Schedule is the strength of the Schedule Opponent efficiency differential average for all games played so far (venue of the games also taken into account) is used as an indicator of the strength of the schedule. The higher the SoS rating, the tougher the schedule; where zero is average.(_Strength of Schedule; a rating of strength of schedule. The rating is denominated in points above/below average, where zero is average. A positive number indicates a harder than average schedule._)
* rSOS - Remaining Strength of the Schedule Opponent efficiency differential average for the remaining games (venue of the games also taken into account) is used as an indicator of the strength of the schedule. The higher the rSOS rating, the tougher the remaining schedule; where zero is average.
* SRS - Simple Rating System; a rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule. The rating is denominated in points above/below average, where zero is average. Doug Drinen, creator of Pro-Football-Reference.com wrote a thorough explanation of this method.
* SAR - Schedule Adjusted Rating An evaluation of teams based on efficiency differential and strength of schedule.
* CONS - Consistency Rating Consistency based on game-by-game efficiency differential variation. The higher the team has consistency rating, the more unpredictable it is.
* a4F - Adjusted Four Factors, calculated by applying weights to the differentials of offensive and defensive four factors. A4F explains the specified proportion of variability in wins.
* ACH - Achievement Level In Terms of Wins, this metric is based on the differential between actual and expected winning percentages. Positive figures indicate overachievement while negative figures indicate the team should have won more games.
* Poss - Possessions (_available since the 1973-74 season in the NBA_); the formula for teams is ``0.5 * ((Tm FGA + 0.4 * Tm FTA - 1.07 * (Tm ORB / (Tm ORB + Opp DRB)) * (Tm FGA - Tm FG) + Tm TOV) + (Opp FGA + 0.4 * Opp FTA - 1.07 * (Opp ORB / (Opp ORB + Tm DRB)) * (Opp FGA - Opp FG) + Opp TOV))``. This formula estimates possessions based on both the team's statistics and their opponent's statistics, then averages them to provide a more stable estimate.

Possession is arguably the most important and entry level metric to understanding basketball analytics basics. Pace, offensive efficiency, and defensive efficiency metrics are all based on possession calculations. Given the common assumption that two teams use almost the same number of possessions in a game, it is easy to calculate offensive and defensive efficiency numbers, when the possession count is adjusted to 100. Basketball metrics gain a meaningful dimension when _**“per 100 possessions”**_ is added.

**How the Possession is Calculated?** It counts as a team possession every time when a player of that team;

1. attempts a field goal,
2. misses a shot and does not get the offensive rebound,
3. turns the ball over (some sources add “turnovers that are assigned to teams” for a more precise possession calculation),
4. goes to the line for two or three shots and either makes the last shot or does not get the rebound of a missed last shot.

Basic Possession Formula= ``0.96*[(Field Goal Attempts)+(Turnovers)+0.44*(Free Throw Attempts)-(Offensive Rebounds)]`` while a more Specific Possession Formula= ``0.5*((Field Goal Attempts + 0.4*Free Throw Attempts – 1.07*(Offensive Rebounds/(Offensive Rebounds + Opponent Defensive Rebounds))*(Field Goal Attempts – FG) + Turnovers) + (Opponent Field Goal Attempts + 0.4*(Opponent Free Throw Attempts) – 1.07*(Opponent Offensive Rebounds)/(Opponent Offensive Rebounds + Defensive Rebounds))*(Opponent Field Goal Attempts – Opponent FG) + Opponent Turnovers))``. This formula estimates possessions based on both the team’s statistics and their opponent’s statistics, then averages them to provide a more stable estimate.

* Pace - Pace Factor (_available since the 1973-74 season in the NBA_); the formula is ``48 * ((Tm Poss + Opp Poss) / (2 * (Tm MP / 5)))``. Pace factor is an estimate of the number of possessions per 48 minutes by a team (_the total number of **possessions** a team uses in a game_). Note: 40 minutes is used in the calculation for the WNBA.

``Pace Calculation Formula=[240/(Team Minutes)]*(Possessionteam+Possessionopponent)/2``. Team minutes is 240 (5×48= 5 players on the court for 48 minutes) in a regulation game. 265 (=5×53) in a 1 OT game. 290 (=5×58) in 2 OT game. 315 (=5×63) in a 3 OT game. 340 (=5×68) in a 4 OT game.

**The .44 and .96 Multipliers?** .44 multiplier has to be taken into account because not all free throws take up a possession. Technical foul shots along with “AND 1″s do not, while there might be more than two free throws on one possession. Research has determined that about 44% of all free throws take up possessions. The .96 multiplier accounts for team offensive rebounds in situations where a missed shot is tipped out of bounds by a defensive player, continuing the possession without an offensive rebound being credited.

* PPP - Points per possession, the points a team score for each possession regardless of a team's pace.

* Power Rankings - is a team evaluation tool for teams which rates the entire league from top to bottom. Power Rankings are based mostly on how good teams really are, by taking into consideration recent performances using a power rankings chart to visualizes the offensive (oEFF) and defensive ratings (dEFF) of each team among other things.

You can do a weekly, rounds or seasonal power rankings to get a better and quick understanding of exactly where the teams currently stand in terms of offensive and defensive efficiency.

* oEFF: Offensive Efficiency, is the number of points a team scores per 100 possessions.
``Offensive Efficiency Formula=100*(Points Scored / Possessions)``. In a game; “offensive efficiency” of a team is equal to defensive efficiency of the opponent team.

* dEFF: Defensive Efficiency, is the number of points a team allows per 100 possessions. ``Defensive Efficiency Formula=100*(Points Allowed / Possessions)``. In a game; “defensive efficiency” of a team is equal to offensive efficiency of the opponent team.

* Plus-Minus, a.k.a. (+/-), simply keeps track of the net changes in the score when a given player is either on or off the court. A variety of combinations including the best two-player, three-player unit, and even five-player combinations for each game can be provided with the plus-minus technique. Plus-Minus Calculation: ``Plus-Minus for Any Player=(Team Points Scored While That Player is On The Court) – (Team Points Allowed While That Player is On The Court)``

**Note:** Relying solely on plus-minus is a huge mistake so, some analytical minds have developed and tried to reduce the +/- flaws in an effort to get more accurate results regarding a player’s impact. Currently, different types of plus-minus metrics are being published.

* Real Plus Minus (RPM) is the player’s average impact in terms of net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions.

**RPM can be broken down into offensive and defensive metrics:**

* Offensive Real Plus-Minus: (ORPM): Player’s average impact on his team’s offensive performance, by the points scored per 100 offensive possessions.
* Defensive Real Plus-Minus: (DRPM): Player’s average impact on his team’s defensive performance, by the points allowed per 100 offensive possessions.

## Conclusion

The incorporation of data analytics into basketball(_Basketball Analytics_), specifically in various basketball leagues and competitions, has led to a significant shift in the way teams strategize, make decisions, source business partners and generally how the game is played. The utilization of advanced basketball analytics has become a crucial aspect of both on-court performance and off-court preparations, by heavily revolutionizing how;- _developing winning strategies_,
_forecasting and preventing player injuries_, and _scouting for potential players_ is carried out today by basketball organizations and actors.

If you are serious about basketball as a player, coach, scout, trainer, fan, an executive or even a journalist then it would be beneficial to learn about the basic and advanced basketball analytics as much as possible and use the knowledge to reach the highest levels of decision making, player performance, business and strategic partnerships.
